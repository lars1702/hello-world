# hello-world
Lars is a newly-baked web-developer from Norway about to embark on a journey to Berlin, where he will be attending a web-development bootcamp. 
Background:
When Lars was a child, he was not as motivated to do school as he is now. Instead, he learned the fundamentals for many academic and social concepts through games! These games were not intended as educational, but still bore implicit teachings on maths and English. 

Before going into software- and web development, Lars' background was in special needs education. Knowing from experience how unmotivating it can be to learn, his goal is to combine the fields to create engaging and immersive learning platforms (apps, websites, games) that will motivate children who have fallen behind, or have always been behind, and teach them that learning can be engaging with the right tools.
